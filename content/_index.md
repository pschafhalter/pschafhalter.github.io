I'm a PhD student working on AI systems at the UC Berkeley
[Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/)
(previously [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/)),
where I'm advised by
[Professor Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/)
and
[Professor Joseph Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/).

I'm interested in how techniques from computer systems can make
self-driving cars safer and more reliable.
To that effect, I've co-designed 2 open-source software projects:

- [ERDOS](/d3) is a dataflow system
for building self-driving car and robotics applications.
- [Pylot](/pylot) is a modular self-driving car
platform that runs on both real cars and in simulation.

Previously, I contributed to several successful open-source projects:

- [Ray](https://ray.io/) is a popular framework for developing distributed applications.
- [Modin](http://modin.org/) scales pandas workflows to terabytes.

I interned at [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/)
with the Pathways Team in 2023, where I focused on sparse computation and
[modularity in language models](/modular-domain-experts).
