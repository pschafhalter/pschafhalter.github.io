I'm a PhD student working on self-driving cars at the UC Berkeley
[RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/),
where I'm advised by
[Professor Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/)
and
[Professor Joseph Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/).

I'm interested in how techniques from computer systems can make
self-driving cars safer and more reliable.
To that effect, I've helped build 2 open-source software projects:
- [ERDOS](https://github.com/erdos-project/erdos/) is a dataflow system
for building self-driving car and robotics applications.
- [Pylot](https://github.com/erdos-project/pylot/) is a modular self-driving car
platform that runs on both real cars and in simulation.

Previously, I contributed to several successful open-source projects:
- [Ray](https://ray.io/) is a popular framework for developing distributed applications.
- [Modin](http://modin.org/) scales pandas workflows to terabytes.
